- **Backend**:

  - ASP.NET Core: A cross-platform, high-performance framework for building web applications with C#.
  - C#: A powerful, statically typed programming language for building robust applications.
  - MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing and managing data. Also I used Mogodb Drive package which help dotnet api to interact with mongodb server.
  - Docker: A platform for building, shipping, and running applications in containers.

- **Frontend**:
  - React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - TypeScript: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing.
